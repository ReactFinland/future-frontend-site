## Collecting information

We collect information from you when you register on our site or fill out a form. When filling out our contact form you may be asked to enter your name, e-mail, and phone number. Please do not submit your personal information if you would not like us to collect it.

## Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.

## Third Party Services

Depending on what features and services you use we store different data.

### Cloudflare

The website is hosted via the service Cloudflare. By visiting the website Cloudflare stores access logs including the IP addresses, stored for less than 30 days. Learn more in [Netlify Privacy Statement](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

### Tito

We use Tito to manage and process the tickets of the conference. An up to date compilation of the personal data they collect and for how long they retain it can be found in their [Fienta Privacy Statement](https://ti.to/privacy).

### Stripe

If you purchase a ticket the payment is handled by Stripe. They store the cardholder name, email address, unique customer identifier, order ID, bank account details, payment card details, card expiration date, CVC code, date/time/amount of transaction, merchant name/ID and location. For further details please see the [Stripe Privacy Statement](https://stripe.com/at/privacy/).

### Mailjet

If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.

We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.

The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for tickets) remain unaffected.
