We held the first edition of Future Frontend conference in 2023 as a successor to [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/). While we followed the lessons learned from our earlier conferences, we also iterated further on it and most importantly expanded the scope to be future oriented. The first two events were moderate successes and as a sponsor you can help us deliver the event beyond the exceptations of our attendees while supporting your business targets (brand visibility, recruitment, making sure we have a world-class event in Finland, etc.). The third edition will take place 27-28.5 at Dipoli, Espoo, Finland. Before the conference, we have one day of workshops distributed to our partner companies.

## International speakers with local flavor included

For Future Frontend, we use a single track format with eight sessions. Each themed session has two speakers. We include leading names from the community while not forgetting local talent. The choice aligns well with our target of connecting Finland with the global frontend space.

The single track format gives each of our visitors a shared experience while removing the burden of choice. That is not to say there are no benefits to running multiple tracks but in our experience single track works the best for us while allowing to manage costs as we cover accommodation and trips of our speakers.

We do not offer speaker slots to our sponsors. Occasionally there may have been a speaker or two from a sponsoring company but that is due to the merits of the speakers, not due to a specific arrangement. We know some conferences do it the other way but this has been our policy so far and it feels like it has been a good one.

## Focused audience

Based on the first edition, it is safe to say that Future Frontend attracts senior-level developers. The first edition was surprisingly international and we expect that even for the third edition majority of the participants might come from abroad. Our target is to reach between 200 and 300 attendees although it is difficult to promise given attendance depends on multiple factors beyond our control.

This is not to say juniors are not welcome but it seems that due to our speaker selection and positioning the conference is well suited for seniors wanting to understand what is the next thing. In our schedule, we try to include both advanced and inspirational content to keep it varied. Occasionally we also bring speakers outside of technology to keep things interesting for our attendees.

For earlier events, our attendees have been from consulting and product companies (roughly half each) including several visitors from the public sector.

## National and international visibility

By supporting our conference, you will be visible both on a national and international level. Most importantly you help us push the conference to the next level as extras, such as the afterparty, are funded through our sponsorships.

## Dipoli, our amazing venue

For the third edition, we will use [Dipoli](https://www.aalto.fi/en/locations/dipoli) as our venue. Dipoli is the main building of Aalto University and it is reknown for its architecture. What makes the building interesting from a sponsor point of view is the amount of lounge space allowing us to offer an ample amount of space for you to set up your booth.

Besides loung space, Dipoli hall is great for our purposes as it can be split in half to allow easy catering during the breaks. The hall itself is spacious and can fit more people than we can imagine to attract.

## Your spot to shine

Sponsorships are a part of corporate branding. Even if you are not recruiting, by supporting Future Frontend you are in a good company. We try to offer sponsorships at different levels with different amounts of commitment and I hope you find a plan that makes sense for you.

Often sponsors end up doing their own activities outside of a conference and we are more than happy to support you with these sort of efforts in terms of marketing for example.

Although it might be an obvious thing to say, your sponsorship helps us to keep on organizing these events. It takes a considerable amount of time each year and through sponsoring you allow this tradition to continue. Although there might not be immediate benefits from the sponsorship, we believe there is value in the fact that we have a top class conference within its niche in Finland.

## Only frontend focused conference in Finland

Future Frontend is the only frontend focused conference in Finland and one of the few in the Nordics. The scope allows us to include speakers with diverse backgrounds and we do our best to find sixteen speakers that give our visitors something to take back home. It is not only the conference experience they take back, but also a piece of Finland. For some, our conference is the only reason why they might visit our little country and most go back home with fond memories in mind.
