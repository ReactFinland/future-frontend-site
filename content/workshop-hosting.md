## Workshop Hosting

In case you are looking for an alternative way to be visible at Future Frontend or complement your sponsorship, hosting one or two of our workshops gives an option to achieve just that. It is the easiest way for you to showcase your fancy office space at the center of Helsinki and literally get developers to your office.

We hold the workshops 11-12.6.24 (potentially 10.6 as well). The workshops are capped to 20 people and run in a full-day format (09:00-17:00). The only expectation besides the space is that you offer lunch to our visitors. In return we'll list you as a partner on the site unless you are our sponsor already.
