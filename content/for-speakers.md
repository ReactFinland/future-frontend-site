## Hotel

We'll book four nights (plus extra night per workshop) at a hotel based on your travel dates. This includes breakfast. The hotel will charge you for any extra nights.

We'll query the dates separately and you won't receive a separate confirmation from the hotel as everything will be booked in bulk.

The hotel hasn't been specified yet but we'll make sure it's close to the venue and it will have an adequate level so you can sleep well and have access to good services.

### How to get to the hotel?

If you take a taxi, save the receipt so we can reimburse you. There are several taxis in the airport, take reputable one like Taksi Helsinki. Note that it's not cheap, expect 50 euros.

Another option is to use public transport as you can reach the center easily using it. It is also considerably cheaper.

## Workshops

The location for the workshops hasn't been specified yet but we'll go with one that offers multiple small rooms and some level of catering. As we know more, this answer will be updated.

Workshop hosts, if you want to send specific information to workshop attendees, let me (Juho) know and I'll do it through the ticket platform.

## Giving the talk

We've prepared a simple yet effective process for the talks. It works as follows:

1. Show up at the speakers' room about half an hour before the session of your talk. The speakers' room is close to the main hall and it's impossible to miss. It also doubles as our technical room.
2. We'll guide you shortly before the session from the speakers' room to the main hall and do a quick tech check. If you want, you can also do this on some break before your talk and it's a good idea especially if you have audio or video elements in your presentation.
3. During the session, you'll give your performance. I expect you to pair with your session partner to ensure the talks flow well to each other.
4. After the session, there will be an option for you to get a photo done. We offer this as a service to our speakers as often people have poor social media photos and it's nice to have one that's not bad.

## Speakers' dinner

The speakers' dinner will be held after the workshops on Wednesday and we'll go from the front of the hotel at 18:00.

If you want to get to the restaurant on your own, please let us know so we don't wait for you. :)
