## Booking flights

We'll use Travelperk for booking flights as the service will invoice our organization automatically and you don't have to spend your money on flights. If you want us to refund taxi/bus/train, please take receipts and deliver them to us after the conference so you'll get your money back.

## Hotel - Heymo 1

We'll book four nights (plus extra night per workshop) at a [Heymo 1 (Miestentie 5, 02150 Espoo)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qBN3UvZqdPGnx74m6), a nearby hotel, based on your travel dates. The hotel includes breakfast and the hotel will charge you for any extra nights. We'll query the dates separately and you won't receive a separate confirmation from the hotel as everything will be booked in bulk.

Note that we do not cover extras, like minibar, and it is up to you to take care of charges like this as you leave the hotel.

### How to get to the hotel?

Since we're located at Otaniemi, there are two good options:

1. Take a train to Helsinki main railway station and the jump to a subway headed to Kivenlahti (M1) or Tapiola (M2). You should leave at the stop Keilaniemi. You'll need an ABC ticket ([see HSL app](https://www.hsl.fi/)) to complete this journey and it will cost roughly five euros. Expect the travel to take about one hour. There's a bus option too but most likely a combination of train and subway is more comfortable.
2. Take a taxi. The taxi trip takes around half an hour minutes. Take care when choosing a taxi, though, as some are considerably more expensive than others and it may make sense to negotiate the price beforehand. Good companies to choose from are Taksi Helsinki (**not** Taksi Heslinki), Kovanen, and Lähitaksi. Expect the taxi to cost roughly 50 €.

In either case, keep the receipts so we can refund you after the conference.

## Workshops

The workshops are distributed around Helsinki to office spaces and you can find the exact addresses on the workshop page.

If you want to send specific information to workshop attendees, let me (Juho) know through conference email or Slack and I'll do it through the ticket platform.

## Setting up an installation

If you have plans to have a physical installation at the conference space, please visit [Dipoli (Otakaari 24, Espoo)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DVdoeyuVh3qjB7U58) at a time specified later (TODO).

## Giving the talk

We've prepared a simple yet effective process for the talks. It works as follows:

1. Show up at the speakers' room about half an hour before the session of your talk. The speakers' room can be found at the ground floor and our registration staff can point you there. Unfortunately the fireplace is out of order.
2. We'll guide you shortly before the session from the speakers' room to the main hall and do a quick tech check. If you want, you can also do this on some break before your talk and it's a good idea especially if you have audio or video elements in your presentation.
3. During the session, you'll give your performance. I expect you to pair with your session partner to ensure the talks flow well to each other.
4. After the session, there will be an option for you to get a photo done. We offer this as a service to our speakers as often people have poor social media photos and it's nice to have one that's not bad. We will also produce video interviews (3-5 minutes) to give you additional coverage.

Note that we'll capture audience questions for you using [Slido](https://www.slido.com/). Using the service allows moderation and ranking while being fun to the audience.

We can also do physical setup for you in case you need chairs etc. on the stage. For any physical setup, let us know beforehand.
