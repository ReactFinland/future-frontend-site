The frontend is the part of an application, or an experience, that is the most visible. For a frontend developer, it's a challenge how to craft that portion. At the **Future Frontend** conference, we'll imagine the future together. In this event, you'll have a chance to meet the leading minds of the space and return back to work filled with visions of the future.

Future Frontend is the successor of [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/). We felt React is getting stable, and perhaps less exciting, as a topic and therefore we designed to adjust our sights. Future Frontend is exactly that, a way to look at the current trends and learn from them.

## Future Frontend in a nutshell

The conference follows good practices we discovered while running React Finland and we've summarized it below:

* 06-07.06.2023 - Workshops (sold separately from the conference)
* 08-09.06.2023 - Single track conference, 8 themed sessions, 2 speakers per session, 16 speakers in total
* Location: Helsinki, Finland. The conference itself takes place at [Pörssitalo](http://porssitalo.fi/) while workshops will be held somewhere near (to be decided). [Check venuu.fi photos](https://venuu.fi/tilat/porssitalo) to understand better what a great space it is for our conference.
* Attendees: We can fit 250 people and our target is 200-250 for the first edition.
* Language: English.

## Why should I come to the Future Frontend conference?

Conferences like Future Frontend compress time and space. They bring people with wildly different backgrounds together in the same space for a short file. It's a time for meeting new people, getting inspired, and learning. You'll meet developers like Miško Hevery (Angular.js, [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/)), Ryan Carniato ([Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/)), Matthew Phillips ([Astro](https://astro.build/)), and many more.

Besides the conference, you'll have a chance to learn through workshops and we've included four topics to choose from. On top of the conference program, traditionally our partners have organized their casual program at the end of the days and we end the week with an afterparty.

## What makes Future Frontend special?

Future Frontend is a conference that lets you have a peek at the future, literally. The technology and ideas of tomorrow exist already but are not widespread yet. Simply being aware of what is coming puts you in a strong position as a developer.

For those not living in Finland, this is a good chance to visit this mysterious country in the north. You'll find answers to questions why people are so happy to live here and what makes the country a technology hot spot of the region. It is not the most usual tourist destination but I recommend you book an extra day or two beyond the conference to explore this strange Nordic country with thousands of lakes and an endless amount of forest.

## How can I convince my boss to visit Future Frontend?

In short, it's an investment to you and your professional development. It's not often that you get to meet so many bright minds in so short time. We've taken care to organize workshops with diverse topics and it's no uncommon for our participants to take part in a few to get most out of it.

That's not to say there isn't more as there is and you'll find chances to relax in a Finnish sauna and our swimming facilities. According to rumors, our conferences are particularly interesting for backend developers that want to go full stack! Even frontend developers are known to pick up new ideas and go back energized.

Given the conference is held during the Summer, as a bonus you'll get to experience sauna and our long days if you are up for it. We won't charge extra for these services.

## What is included to the ticket price?

The conference ticket includes a lunch and refreshments during the breaks. This means you won't have to budget much extra for eating outside of the event unless you want to. Also afterparty (09.06) is included and there will be enough to eat and drink not to mention lighter program (karaoke, board games, etc. depending on what we come up with).

For workshops, we provide at least refreshments during the breaks and in the past we've also included lunch arrangements for the full-day ones to reduce stress.
