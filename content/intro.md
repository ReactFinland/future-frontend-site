To quote William Gibson, the future is already here â€“ it's just not evenly distributed. The purpose of Future Frontend conference is to give you a glimpse of future. We focus on frontend, mainly web development, related topics in this single track conference held in Helsinki, Finland. The next edition is planned for June, 2024.
