> IMPORTANT! Due to [Helsinki underground renovations](https://www.hsl.fi/en/hsl/news/news/2024/01/renovation-and-construction-work-to-affect-rail-services-in-2024--central-railway-station-metro-station-to-close-for-the-summer), the Central Railway Station metro is out of use during the conference and trains cannot go through it. Please take this into account in your planning.

## What Corona measures do you take?

We follow the [government guidance](https://new.visitfinland.com/en/practical-tips/covid-19/).

## How can I get in touch with other attendees?

The best way to do that is to [join the conference Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/toskaosk/shared_invite/zt-4e8c84ow-JybtzFPZWXpZ8cZBpMy1wQ).

## How to get to Helsinki, Finland?

Geographically Finland is a bit like an island and it's separated from most of the Europe by a sea. That said, there are a few ways to reach Helsinki, Finland:

* If you come from within the country, public transport (bus, train) is a good and affordable option. Expect to spend tens of euros on a trip.
* If you come from Estonia or Sweden, consider using a ferry (about 2h).
* If you come from Germany, there's a [Finnlines ferry](https://www.finnlines.com) from Travemünde to Helsinki (about 29h). It's possible to get an affordable flight especially from Berlin to Helsinki. Another interesting option might be to take a train to Stockholm, then ferry to Turku, and use a train from Turku to Helsinki. It's more involved trip but quite cost effective and it allows you to see more sights on the way.
* If you come from any other location, a detour from any of the places above or direct options (usually a flight) are available. Helsinki is easy to reach by flying as it's the capital city of Finland and the best connected part of the country.

## Where to stay?

Due to the central location of the venue (Paasitorni), compact size of Helsinki center, and good connectivity, you have many options. We've listed some potential options below:

* [Omena Hotels](https://www.omenahotels.com/en/) - Roughly 60-80€ per night. Minimal service. Two separate hotels.
* [Scandic Paasi](https://www.scandichotels.com/hotelreservation/select-rate?hotel=634) - Roughly €140 per night. Note that you can get a discount using the code `CGRO` if you book through the hotel site.

* [Hotel Marski by Scandic](https://www.scandichotels.com/hotels/finland/helsinki/marski-by-scandic) - Roughly €150 per night.
* [Kongressikoti Hotel](http://kongressikoti.fi/) - Roughly 60€ per night.
* [Hostel Diana Park](http://www.dianapark.fi/) - Roughly 30€ per night.

## I am from a country that requires a visa for Finland. How can I get one?

The way it works is that you'll need a letter of recommendation from us. It serves a dual purpose - it will help you to get the visa and it will help you to get across the border as you can show the document when you enter the country.

In order for us to procure this document for you, please send us email (info \<at> futurefrontend.com) including the following information:

* Name
* Date of birth
* Address
* Passport number
* Arrival date
* Leaving date
* Company and position

In response, we'll send you a signed pdf you can then present to your authorities and to ours at the border. You should apply for **visitor visa**.

Note that we can reserve the ticket(s) you want until you receive your visa so that in case denial we don't have to worry about refunds.

## What to do in Helsinki?

There is a lot to see and do. See for example [myhelsinki.fi](https://www.myhelsinki.fi/) for some ideas. If you happen to have a sunny day, a visit to a nearby castle island called [Suomenlinna](https://www.suomenlinna.fi/) is completely worth it and you can catch a ship going there from the city center.

## How to get to the venue? What kind of transport options exist?

There's a direct train from the airport to Helsinki center. HSL operates the local public transport system. You can find a city bike system as well.

To get to airport from the center, you can use train, Finnair buses or taxi. It seems that nowadays there might be some fake taxis, so use reliable taxi services like TaksiHelsinki, Lahitaksi, Kovanen or FixuTaxi. Note that taxis are very expensive in Helsinki so you can expect a 50€ ride per direction.

## What kind of food is available?

We'll provide coffee and snacks during the longer breaks. During the lunch break we use the two restaurants available within the venue. You'll have buffet style food awaiting you and we accommodate to your special needs (vegetarian, vegan, glucose free, etc.) based on your preferences. All the food is included to the price of the conference ticket. The same is true for all of our workshops.

## What to take with you?

Assuming you want to sauna and swim, bring a swimming suit and optionally a towel (often you can borrow one). Personal laptop might go in handy, especially if you participate in the workshops!

## How to follow the conference program?

1. Use the site [schedule](/schedule/).
2. [Subscribe to the conference calendar](https://api.react-finland.fi/calendar-2023.ics). You can import it to your Google Calendar for example.

## How to prepare for the workshops?

To start your workshop as quick and as smooth as possible, it's a good idea to spend some time beforehand. Make sure to install at least the following software to your laptop:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 2.0, or newer
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18.0, or newer
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 6.0, or newer. Consider using either [n](https://github.com/tj/n) or [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing the version.

> Run \`git --version\`, \`node --version\`, and \`npm --version\` to check versions you have installed.

You should check your workshop requirements for any further requirements. Usually a workshop has a Git repository related to it. [Check the workshop description](/workshops/) for a link. If there's one, make sure you set it up while you perform the work above.

## When and how can I register?

Registration is possible in any of the conference days. The desk will be close to the entrance of the venue.

It is **extremely** important that when you register you show your ticket generated by the ticketing system. After showing your ticket, you'll receive a badge and have access to the venue.

## What should I know about Finland?

* We speak Finnish, English, and Swedish (poorly most often but we try our best). Pardon the accent.
* We use Euro as our currency.
* Our electricity network standard voltage is 230 V (50 Hz). The socket style is type F (Schuko) (symmetrical and looks like a pig snout). It accepts plug C and E too.
* Finland is generally considered a safe country. Do **not** try to go past people in the grill queue, through, as that's a common way to find yourself in a trouble (only half kidding).
* Finland has around 5.5 million residents. To give you a comparison point, that's about 1.5 times the population of Berlin spread around the area of whole Finland (roughly the size of Germany).
* When you visit a Finnish household, remember to remove your shoes at the anteroom. It's a common habit and we prefer not to wear shoes inside apart from the public spaces.
