## How to get to Helsinki, Finland?

Geographically Finland is a bit like an island and it's separated from most of the Europe by a sea. That said, there are a few ways to reach Helsinki, Finland:

* If you come from within the country, public transport (bus, train) is a good and affordable option. Expect to spend tens of euros on a trip.
* If you come from Estonia or Sweden, consider using a ferry (about 2h).
* If you come from Germany, there's a [Finnlines ferry](https://www.finnlines.com) from Travemünde to Helsinki (about 29h). It's possible to get an affordable flight especially from Berlin to Helsinki. Another interesting option might be to take a train to Stockholm, then ferry to Turku, and use a train from Turku to Helsinki. It's more involved trip but quite cost effective and it allows you to see more sights on the way.
* If you come from any other location, a detour from any of the places above or direct options (usually a flight) are available. Helsinki is easy to reach by flying as it's the capital city of Finland and the best connected part of the country.

## Where to stay?

There are several options depending on your budget. Due to the location, there are a couple of decently priced hotels and hostels nearby. In addition the venue is easy to reach by public transport giving you more options. We've listed some potential options below:

## I am from a country that requires a visa for Finland. How can I get one?

The way it works is that you'll need a letter of recommendation from us. It serves a dual purpose - it will help you to get the visa and it will help you to get across the border as you can show the document when you enter the country.

In order for us to procure this document for you, please send us email (info \<at> futurefrontend.com) including the following information:

* Name
* Date of birth
* Address
* Passport number
* Arrival date
* Leaving date
* Company and position

In response, we'll send you a signed pdf you can then present to your authorities and to ours at the border. You should apply for a **visitor visa**.

Note that we can reserve the ticket(s) you want until you receive your visa so that in case denial we don't have to worry about refunds.

## What to do in Helsinki?

There is a lot to see and do. See for example [myhelsinki.fi](https://www.myhelsinki.fi/) for some ideas. If you happen to have a sunny day, a visit to a nearby castle island called [Suomenlinna](https://www.suomenlinna.fi/) is completely worth it and you can catch a ship going there from the city center.

## How to get to the venue? What kind of transport options exist?

Assuming you are coming from the direction of Helsinki center, likely using the subway (M1/M2, Aalto University stop) is an easy option. It is roughly one kilometer walk from the subway station.

There are also trams and bus lines that go even closer and you should use [HSL service](https://www.hsl.fi/) to figure out the best connections.

To get to airport from the center, you can use train, Finnair buses or taxi. It seems that nowadays there might be some fake taxis, so use reliable taxi services like TaksiHelsinki, Lahitaksi, Kovanen or FixuTaxi. Note that taxis are very expensive in the region so you can expect a 50€ ride per direction.

## What kind of food is available?

We'll provide coffee and snacks during the longer breaks. The lunch will be served buffet style meaning you can choose what is suitable to you. We will take your food restrictions into account based on what you indicated during registration. All the food is included to the price of the conference ticket. The same is true for all of our workshops.

## What to take with you?

If you want to participate to the workshops, bring your laptop.

## How to follow the conference program?

1. Use the site [schedule](/schedule/).
2. [Subscribe to the conference calendar](https://api.react-finland.fi/calendar-2025.ics). You can import it to your Google Calendar for example.

## How to prepare for the workshops?

To start your workshop as quick and as smooth as possible, it's a good idea to spend some time beforehand. Make sure to install at least the following software to your laptop:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 2.0, or newer
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18.0, or newer
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 6.0, or newer. Consider using either [n](https://github.com/tj/n) or [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing the version.

> Run \`git --version\`, \`node --version\`, and \`npm --version\` to check versions you have installed.

## When and how can I register to the conference?

Registration is possible in any of the conference days. The desk will be close to the entrance of the venue.

It is **extremely** important that when you register you show your ticket generated by the ticketing system. After showing your ticket, you'll receive a badge and have access to the venue.

## What Corona measures do you take?

We follow the [government guidance](https://new.visitfinland.com/en/practical-tips/covid-19/).

## What should I know about Finland?

* We speak Finnish, English, and Swedish (poorly most often but we try our best). Pardon the accent.
* We use Euro as our currency.
* Our electricity network standard voltage is 230 V (50 Hz). The socket style is type F (Schuko) (symmetrical and looks like a pig snout). It accepts plug C and E too.
* Finland is generally considered a safe country. Do **not** try to go past people in the grill queue, through, as that's a common way to find yourself in a trouble (only half kidding).
* Finland has around 5.5 million residents. To give you a comparison point, that's about 1.5 times the population of Berlin spread around the area of whole Finland (roughly the size of Germany).
* When you visit a Finnish household, remember to remove your shoes at the anteroom. It's a common habit and we prefer not to wear shoes inside apart from the public spaces.
