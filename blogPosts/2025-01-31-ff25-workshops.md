We run a series of [workshops](/workshops/) as a part of Future Frontend 2025 (27-28.05, Espoo, Finland). The full day workshops take place 26.05 around Helsinki and we have four topics to choose from. Each workshop has been priced at 199€ (inc. VAT) includes lunch and refreshments.

We have included topics a variety of topics ranging from React to AI, design systems, and self-development.

## Hands-on React Server Components, Server Actions, and Forms in the Next.js App Router

In our [React workshop](/workshops/#hands-on-react-server-components-server-actions-and-forms-in-the-next-js-app-router) held by Devlin Duldulao and Aurora Scharff, we focus on the latest features of the popular [React](https://react.dev/) library. React has changed a lot during the past few years and this workshop will help you to catch up with the changes in an effective manner. You should join the workshop if you have some familiarity with React already and want to understand how to get most out of the latest features.

Devlin and Aurora will also have a React block within the conference program where they highlight some of the key points. The workshop will obviously allow you understand the topic in much greater detail.

## Designing and Implementing Practical Industry Level Frontend AI solutions

By participating into our [AI workshop](/workshops/#designing-and-implementing-practical-industry-level-frontend-ai-solutions) held by Zak Allal, you will develop a series of AI driven applications while gaining a deeper appreciation of the current developments within the field. You should already have some familiarity with AI and web development to get most out of the workshop. The main thing you will learn is how to integrate AI to your user interfaces in an effective manner.

You might remember Zak from our conference last year as he was discussed [Finnish Companion](https://www.finnishcompanion.com/), a service meant for people wanting to learn Finnish language. Finnish Companion leverages AI heavily and Zak has gained a great understanding of the related technologies during the development of his free product. Zak will be on stage again this year as he will focus on the topic of cybersecurity and show us how to harden our software against bad actors.

## Design Systems for Legacies

Design systems are a recurring topic in our conferences and they return again this year. To keep up with the theme, Thaís Santos and m4dz will run a [design system workshop](/workshops/#design-systems-for-legacies) that has a specific focus on developing a design system on top of existing codebase as the situation is more complex then. This is the workshop for you if you want to improve your understanding of design systems regardless of your background. It is even better if you have a use case of your own in mind as that can be discussed in the workshop to help you proceed with your work.

Thaís and m4dz will also cover design systems in the conference as they will discuss the challenges of introducing a design system to an aging system and consider the future of product design and design tools.

## Human and machine: Undoing the impact of living a tech-native life

As an ICT worker, you probably spend a non-trivial amount of time seated. It is well understood that this is not the most healthy way to live long term. In this [self-development workshop](/workshops/#human-and-machine-undoing-the-impact-of-living-a-tech-native-life) by Georgios Diamantopoulos we focus on how to undo the impact of this kind of lifestyle so we can remain healthy as we age. The workshop has a modest amount of theory and you will spend most of the time learning how to maintain yourself. Out of all workshops, this is probably the one that's most accessible to all regardless of their background and investing into yourself is always a good idea.

Georgios will also present the topic in our work-life balance focused block and give his view on how we can do better.

## Conclusion

I know investing a full day to a workshop can be a lot to ask. That said, I think we have good options to choose from with while allowing you to get more out of your Future Frontend experience. Even if the conference itself is not that interesting to you, you are still welcome to participate.
