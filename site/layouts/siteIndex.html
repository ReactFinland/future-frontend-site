          >To quote William Gibson, the future is already here â€“ it's just not
          evenly distributed. The purpose of Future Frontend conference is to
          give you a glimpse of future. The second edition takes place 13-14
          June, 2024 while the workshops are held 10-12 June, 2024.

          >[The first edition](/2023) was a success and helped to establish the
          event. Our target for the second edition is to grow further (up to 300
          attendees) and yet again bring both international and local developers
          together to shape the future in this single track event.

        <Heading level="2">Who is coming to the conference</Heading>
        <Markdown>
          The conference attracts particularly international senior developers
          wanting to catch up with the latest trends and to see the country. It
          is not uncommon to combine the trip with a bit of sightseeing or a
          trip to a cottage.

          second one is from React Finland 2022. The next Future Frontend will
          take place at the same venue as the latter event.</Markdown

        <Heading level="2">Conference format</Heading>
        <Markdown
          >One of the aspects that makes Future Frontend unique in its category
          is the format we use for the event. Over the two days of the event, we
          run eight themed sessions with two speakers each. Each pair gets a 1.5
          hour slot and usually this means two talks and a panel on the topic.
        </Markdown>
        <Markdown>
          Beyond this, we have made sure you have enough time to recharge during
          breaks as for some people the hallway track is the best part of the
          conference as you get to meet other developers. On top of this, we
          take care to organize more unofficial program after conference days
          with our partners and an afterparty for Friday is guaranteed.

        <Heading level="2">Themes for 2024</Heading>
        <Markdown>
          For 2024, we have chosen the following themes: compilers, artificial
          intelligence, design, UI in combination with design and edge, green
          computing, standardization, user interaction, and demonstrations.
        </Markdown>
        <Markdown
          >In other words, there will be plenty of inspiration available
          especially for a frontend-minded developer. A quote from 2023 attendee
          puts it well what the conference is all about:</Markdown

          > It was great, I enjoyed it so much. Helsinki was awesome. I realized
          that I live in bubble doing always the same apps and that there are
          also other use-cases and approaches. - Marek

        <Heading level="2">Workshops for 2024</Heading>

          As often you learn the best by doing, we have made sure to include
          [workshops](/workshops) before the conference days. The topics include
          Web Audio, Qwik, TypeScript, Astro, and KV databases.
