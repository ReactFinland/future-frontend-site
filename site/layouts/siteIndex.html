          event. Our target for the second edition is to grow further (up to 300
          attendees) and yet again bring both international and local developers
          together to shape the future in this single track event.

          In the first edition, the audience included largely international
          senior level developers. For the second edition, our hope is that more
          product and business developers discover the conference as we have
          included a healthy mix of product insights to the schedule this time
          around.

          If you are coming from abroad, it is not uncommon to combine the trip
          with a bit of sightseeing or a trip to a cottage as it is likely the
          best time to visit Finland as it is reasonably warm and you will miss
          all the mosquitoes.

        <Markdown
          >One of the aspects that makes Future Frontend unique in its category
          is the format we use for the event. Over the two days of the event, we
          run eight themed sessions with two speakers each apart from an
          exception or two. Each session gets a 1.5 hour slot and usually this
          means two talks and a panel on the topic although surprises are
          possible.
        </Markdown>
        <Markdown>
          Beyond this, we have made sure you have enough time to recharge during
          breaks as for some people the hallway track is the best part of the
          conference as you get to meet other developers. On top of this, we
          take care to organize more unofficial program after conference days
          with our partners and an afterparty for Friday is guaranteed.

        <Heading level="2">Themes for 2024</Heading>
        <Markdown>
          For 2024, our main themes are artificial intelligence (AI), web
          design, and web development. To be more specific, we'll discuss
          compilers, design in combination with edge computing, green computing,
          standardization, and user interaction.
        </Markdown>
        <Markdown>
          The chosen triad means that regardless of your background, you will be
          exposed to new ideas that will shape your way of thinking and give you
          a better idea of what is coming next in the space.
