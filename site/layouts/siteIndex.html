          evenly distributed. The purpose of Future Frontend conference is to
          give you a glimpse of future. The third edition takes place 27-28 May,
          2025 (Dipoli, Espoo, Finland) while the workshops are held 26th of
          May, 2025 around Helsinki.

        <Markdown as="p"
          >Historically our events have been small (up to 300 people for React
          Finland) and we tend favor quality over quantity in both terms of
          content and attendees. Our single track format, ample breaks, and
          additional program allow you to gain understanding of what is going in
          the field while gaining new acquaintances.

        <Heading level="2">Who is coming to the conference</Heading>
        <Markdown>
          Future Frontend attracts senior level developers and designers.
          Roughly half of our attendees are local while the rest join us from
          abroad making Future Frontend and international conference with a
          Finnish twist. Although some of the topics might be heavy, our
          approach is light and atmosphere relaxed.
        </Markdown>
        <Markdown>
          If you are coming from abroad, it is not uncommon to combine the trip
          with a bit of sightseeing or a trip to a cottage as it is likely the
          best time to visit Finland as it is reasonably warm and you will miss
          all the mosquitoes.

        <Heading level="2">Conference format</Heading>
        <Markdown
          >One of the aspects that makes Future Frontend unique in its category
          is the format we use for the event. Over the two days of the event, we
          run eight themed sessions with two speakers although occasional
          exceptions are allowed. Each session gets a 1.5 hour slot and usually
          this means two talks and a panel on the topic. This means there's
          enough time to get into detail and to address your questions.
        </Markdown>
        <Markdown>
          Beyond this, we have made sure you have enough time to recharge during
          breaks as for some people the hallway track is the best part of the
          conference as you get to meet other developers. On top of this, we
          take care to organize more unofficial program after conference days
          with our partners and sauna after the second conference day is
          guaranteed.
        </Markdown>

        <Heading level="2">Themes for 2025</Heading>
        <Markdown>
          For 2025, our main themes are within the intersection of artificial
          intelligence (AI), web design, and web development. To give you
          examples of specific themes, we'll discuss performance, design
          systems, accessibility, and a softer theme of work-life balance.
          Although we focus primarily on technical topics, we try to include
          content that serves you beyond knowledge.
